## Rules for Contributing

### Issues 

**Allways** use the issue templates: 
 - use [this template](https://github.com/JohnyP36/VBA-Calendar/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=standard.yml)
 - **Do you have a question? Follow [this template](https://github.com/JohnyP36/VBA-Calendar/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&template=questions.yml)** </br>

If the issue template isn't followed your issue will be labeled as `invalid` and be closed

---
### Pull requests
Use the template that has been made available for this.
#### Don't pull a request for just one or two (max. four issues). Only pull request if there are a lot of changes at once.
---
### _Commit message_
Keep it simple. 
 1. Put in the title box `A:` if something is added, `C` for changing something and an `R` for removing something. 
 2. Put here after the file name of the file you changed
 3. At the end put the issue number if appliable. 
So - for example `C: Code/Select Day.cls fix #74`. The issue itself will contains all the details.
